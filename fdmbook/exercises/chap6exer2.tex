The proof of convergence of 1-step methods in Section 6.3 shows that the
global error goes to zero as $k\goto 0$.
However, this bound may be totally useless in estimating the actual error
for a practical calculation.

For example, suppose we solve $u'=-10u$ with $u(0)=1$ up to time $T=10$, so
the true solution is $u(T)=e^{-100} \approx 3.7\times 10^{-44}$.
Using forward Euler with a time step $k=0.01$,  
the computed solution is $U^N = (.9)^{100}\approx 2.65 \times
10^{-5}$, and so $E^N \approx U^N$.
Since $L=10$ for this problem, the error bound (6.16) gives
\eqlex{a}
\|E^N\| \leq e^{100}\cdot 10 \cdot \|\tau \|_\infty \approx 2.7 \times
10^{44} \|\tau\|_\infty.
\end{equation} 
Here $\|\tau\|_\infty =|\tau^0| \approx 50 k$, so this upper bound on the
error does go to zero as $k\goto 0$, but obviously it is not a realistic
estimate of the error. It is too large by a factor of about $10^{50}$.

The problem is that the estimate (6.16) is based on the Lipschitz
constant $L=|\lambda|$, which gives a bound that grows exponentially in time
even when the true and computed solutions are decaying exponentially.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine the computed solution and error bound (6.16) for the problem
$u' = 10u$ with $u(0)=1$ up to time $T=10$.  Note that the error bound is
the same as in the case above, but now it is a reasonable estimate of the
actual error.

\item A more realistic error bound for the case where $\lambda<0$ can be
obtained by rewriting (6.17) as
\[
\unp = \Phi(U^n)
\]
and then determining the Lipschitz constant for the function $\Phi$.  
Call this constant $M$.  Prove that if $M\leq 1$  and $E^0=0$ then 
\[
|E^n| \leq  T\|\tau\|_\infty
\]
for $nk\leq T$, a bound that is similar to (6.16) but without the
exponential term.


\item Show that for forward Euler applied to $u'=\lambda
u$ we can take $M = |1+k\lambda|$.  Determine $M$ for the case $\lambda =
-10$ and $k=0.01$ and use this in the bound from part (b).
Note that this is much better than the bound \eqnex{a}.

\end{enumerate}
