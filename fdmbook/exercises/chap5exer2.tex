\exercise[(Lipschitz constant for an ODE)]{5.2}

Let $f(u) = \log(u)$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine the best possible Lipschitz constant for this function over
$2\leq u < \infty$.

\item Is $f(u)$ Lipschitz continuous over $0<u<\infty$?

\item Consider the initial value problem
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
u'(t) &= \log(u(t)),\\
u(0) &= 2.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Explain why we know that this problem has a unique solution for all $t\geq 0$
based on the existence and uniqueness theory described in Section 5.2.1.
(Hint: Argue that $f$ is Lipschitz continuous in  a domain that the
solution never leaves, though the domain is
not symmetric about $\eta=2$ as assumed in the theorem quoted in the book.)
\end{enumerate}
