\exercise[(nonlinear pendulum)]{2.7}

\begin{enumerate} 

\item Write a program to solve the boundary value problem for the
nonlinear pendulum as discussed in the text.  See if you can find yet
another solution for the boundary conditions illustrated in Figures 2.4
and 2.5.

\item Find a numerical solution to this BVP with the same
general behavior as seen in Figure 2.5 for the case of a longer time
interval, say $T=20$, again with $\alpha=\beta=0.7$.  Try larger values of
$T$.  What does $\max_i \theta_i$ approach as $T$ is increased?  Note that
for large $T$ this solution  exhibits ``boundary layers''.

\end{enumerate}
