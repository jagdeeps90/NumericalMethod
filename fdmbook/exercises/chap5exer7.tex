\exercise[(matrix exponential for a defective matrix)]{5.7}

Consider the IVP
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
u_1' &= 2u_1,\\
u_2' &= 3u_1 + 2u_2,
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
with initial conditions specified at time $t=0$.  Solve this problem in two
different ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Solve the first equation, which only involves $u_1$, and then insert
this function into the second equation to obtain a nonhomogeneous linear
equation for $u_2$.  Solve this using (5.8).

\item Write the system as $u' = Au$ and compute the matrix exponential using
(D.35) to obtain the solution.  (See Appendix C.3 for a discussion of the
Jordan Canonical form in the defective case.)
\end{enumerate}
