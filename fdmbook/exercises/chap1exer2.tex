\begin{enumerate}
\item
Use the method of undetermined coefficients to set up the $5\times 5$
Vandermonde system that would determine a fourth-order accurate
finite difference approximation to $u''(x)$ based on 5 equally spaced
points,
\[
u''(x) = c_{-2} u(x-2h) + c_{-1} u(x-h) + c_0u(x) + c_1u(x+h) +
c_2u(x+2h) + O(h^4).
\]

\item 
Compute the coefficients using the 
\matlab\ code {\tt fdstencil.m} available from the website, and check that
they satisfy the system you determined in part (a).

\item
Test this finite difference formula to approximate $u''(1)$ for 
$u(x) = \sin(2x)$ with values of $h$ from the array 
{\tt hvals = logspace(-1, -4, 13)}.
Make a
table of the error vs.\ $h$ for several values of $h$ and compare against
the predicted error from the leading term of the expression printed by
{\tt fdstencil}. 
You may want to look at the m-file {\tt chap1example1.m} for
guidance on how to make such a table.

Also produce a log-log plot of the absolute value of the error vs.~$h$.  

You should observe the predicted accuracy for larger values of $h$.  For
smaller values, numerical cancellation in computing the linear combination
of $u$ values impacts the accuracy observed.
