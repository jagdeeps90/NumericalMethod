\exercise[(Embedded Runge-Kutta method)]{5.15}

Consider the embedded Runge-Kutta method defined by the tableau below.
Apply one step of this method to 
$u' = \lambda u$ to obtain both $U^{n+1}$ and $\hat U^{n+1}$.  What is the
order of accuracy of each method?  What error estimate would be obtained
when using this embedded method on this problem?  How does it compare to the
actual error in the lower order method?  (Assume $U^n$ is the exact value at
time $t_n$).
