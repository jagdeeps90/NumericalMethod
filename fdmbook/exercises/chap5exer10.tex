Determine the coefficients $\beta_0,~\beta_1,~\beta_2$ for the third
order, 2-step Adams-Moulton method.  Do this in two different ways:
\begin{enumerate} 
 \item Using the expression for the local truncation error in Section 5.9.1,
 \item Using the relation
 \[
 u(t_{n+2}) = u(t_{n+1}) + \int_{t_{n+1}}^{t_{n+2}}\,f(u(s))\,ds.
 \]
 Interpolate  a quadratic polynomial $p(t)$ through the three values
 $f(U^n),~f(U^{n+1})$ and $f(U^{n+2})$ and then integrate this polynomial
 exactly to obtain the formula.  The coefficients of the polynomial will
 depend on the three values $f(U^{n+j})$.   It's easiest to use the
 ``Newton form'' of the interpolating polynomial and consider the three
times $t_n=-k$, $t_{n+1}=0$, and $t_{n+2}=k$ so that $p(t)$ has the form
\[
p(t) = A + B(t+k) + C(t+k)t
\]
where $A,~B$, and $C$ are the appropriate divided differences based on the
data.  Then integrate from $0$ to $k$.   (The method has the same
coefficients at any time, so this is valid.)
\end{enumerate}
