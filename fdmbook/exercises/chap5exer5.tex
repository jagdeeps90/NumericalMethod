\exercise[(matrix exponential form of solution)]{5.5}

The initial value problem
\[
v''(t) = -4v(t), \qquad v(0) = v_0,\quad v'(0) = v_0'
\]
has the solution $v(t) = v_0\cos(2t) + \half v_0' \sin(2t)$.  Determine this
solution by rewriting the ODE as a first order system $u' = Au$ so that
$u(t) = e^{At}u(0)$ and then computing the matrix exponential using (D.30)
in Appendix D.
