\exercise[(inverse matrix and Green's functions)]{2.1}

\begin{enumerate} 
\item Write out the $5\times 5$
matrix $A$ from (2.43) for the boundary value problem
$u''(x)=f(x)$ with $u(0)=u(1)=0$ for  $h = 0.25$.

\item Write out the $5\times 5$
inverse matrix $A^{-1}$ explicitly for this problem.

\item
If $f(x)=x$, determine the discrete approximation to the solution of the
boundary value problem on this grid and sketch this solution and the five
Green's functions whose sum gives this solution.

\end{enumerate}
