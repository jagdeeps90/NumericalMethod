\exercise[(Solving a difference equation)]{6.6}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the general solution of the linear difference equation
\[
U^{n+2} - U^{n+1} + 0.25U^n =0.
\]
\item Determine the particular solution with initial data $U^0 = 2,
~U^1=3$.  What is $U^{10}$?
\item Consider the iteration
\[
\bcm U^{n+1} \\ U^{n+2}  \ecm =
\bcm 0&1 \\ -0.25&1 \ecm \bcm U^n \\ \unp \ecm.
\]
The matrix appearing here is the ``companion matrix'' (D.19) for the above
difference equation.   If this matrix is called $A$, then we can
determine $U^n$ from the starting values using the $n$th power of this
matrix.  Compute $A^n$ as discussed in Appendix D.2 and show that this gives
the same solution found in part (b).
\end{enumerate}
