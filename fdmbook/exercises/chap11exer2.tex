\exercise[(Strang splitting)]{11.2}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Show that the Strang splitting is second order accurate on the problem
(11.18) by comparing
\eqlex{a}
\exp\left(\half Ak\right)\, \exp(Bk)\, \exp\left(\half Ak\right)
\end{equation}
with (11.22).

\item Show that second order accuracy on (11.18) can also be achieved by
alternating the splitting (11.17) in even numbered time steps with
\eqlex{b}
\begin{split} 
U^* &= {\cal N}_B(U^n,k),\\
U^{n+1} &= {\cal N}_A(U^*,k)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
in odd numbered times steps.

\end{enumerate}
