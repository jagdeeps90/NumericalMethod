\exercise[(Fibonacci sequence)]{6.8}

A Fibonacci sequence is generated by starting with $F_0=0$
and $F_1=1$ and summing the last two terms to get the next term in the
sequence, so $F_{n+1} = F_{n} + F_{n-1}$.   

\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that for large $n$ the ratio $F_n / F_{n-1}$ approaches the
``golden ratio'' $\phi \approx 1.618034$.

\item Show that the result of part (a) holds if any two integers are used as
the starting values $F_0$ and $F_1$, assuming they are not both zero.

\item Is this true for all real starting values $F_0$ and $F_1$ (not both
zero)?

\end{enumerate}
