The m-file \verb+advection_LW_pbc.m+ implements the Lax-Wendroff method for
the advection equation on $0\leq x\leq 1$ with periodic boundary conditions.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Modify the m-file to create a version \verb+advection_lf_pbc.m+
implementing the leapfrog method and verify that this is second order accurate.
Note that you will have to specify two levels of initial data.  For the
convergence test set $U^1_j = u(x_j,k)$, the true solution at time $k$.

\item Modify \verb+advection_lf_pbc.m+ so that the initial data consists of
a wave packet
\eqlex{a}
\eta(x) = \exp(-\beta(x-0.5)^2) \sin(\xi x)
\end{equation} 
Work out the true solution $u(x,t)$ for this data.
Using $\beta = 100$, $\xi=80$ and $U^1_j = u(x_j,k)$, test that your code
still exhibits second order accuracy for $k$ and $h$ sufficiently small.

\item Using $\beta = 100$, $\xi=150$ and $U^1_j = u(x_j,k)$, estimate the
group velocity of the wave packet computed with leapfrog using $m=199$ and
$k = 0.4h$.  How well does this compare with the  value (10.52) predicted by
the modified equation?

\end{enumerate}
