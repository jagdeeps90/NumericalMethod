\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine the general solution to the linear difference equation 
$2U^{n+3} - 5U^{n+2} + 4U^{n+1} - U^n = 0$.

{\bf Hint:} One root of the characteristic polynomial is at $\zeta=1$.

\item Determine the solution to this difference equation with the starting
values $U^0=11$, $U^1=5$, and $U^2=1$.  What is $U^{10}$?

\item Consider the LMM
\[
2U^{n+3} - 5U^{n+2} + 4U^{n+1} - U^n = k(\beta_0 f(U^n) + \beta_1 f(U^{n+1})).
\]
For what values of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ is local truncation error
$\bigo(k^2)$?

\item Suppose you use the values of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ just determined
in this LMM.  Is this a convergent method?

\end{enumerate}
