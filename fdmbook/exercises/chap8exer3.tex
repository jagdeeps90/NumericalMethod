\exercise[(Stability region of RKC methods)]{8.3}

Use the m-file {\tt plotSrkc.m} to plot the stability region for the
second-order accurate $s$-stage Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev methods for $r=3,~6$
with damping parameter $\epsilon = 0.05$ and compare the size of these
regions to those shown for the first-order accurate RKC methods in Figures
8.7 and 8.8.
