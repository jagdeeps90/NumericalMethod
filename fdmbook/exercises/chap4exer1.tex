\exercise[(Convergence of SOR)]{4.1}

The m-file \verb+iter_bvp_Asplit.m+ implements the Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and
SOR matrix splitting methods on the linear system arising from the boundary
value problem $u''(x) = f(x)$ in one space dimension.  

\begin{enumerate}
\item Run this program for each method and produce a plot similar to 
Figure~4.2.

\item The convergence behavior of SOR is very sensitive to the choice of
$\omega$ ({\tt omega} in the code).  Try changing from the optimal $\omega$
to $\omega = 1.8$ or 1.95.

\item Let $g(\omega) = \rho(G(\omega))$ be the spectral radius of the
iteration matrix $G$ for a given value of $\omega$.  Write a program to
produce a plot of $g(\omega)$ for $0\leq \omega \leq 2$.

\item From equations (4.22) one might be tempted to try to implement SOR as
\begin{verbatim}
     for iter=1:maxiter
        uGS = (DA - LA) \ (UA*u + rhs);
        u = u + omega * (uGS - u);
        end
\end{verbatim}
where the matrices have been defined as in \verb+iter_bvp_Asplit.m+.
Try this computationally and observe that it does not work well.  Explain
what is wrong with this and derive the correct expression (4.24).

\end{enumerate}
