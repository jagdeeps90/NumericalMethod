\exercise[(Green's function with Neumann boundary conditions)]{2.2}

\begin{enumerate} 
\item
Determine the Green's functions for the two-point boundary
value problem $u''(x) = f(x)$ on $0<x<1$ with a Neumann boundary condition
at $x=0$ and a Dirichlet condition at $x=1$, i.e, find the function
$G(x,\bar x)$ solving
\[
u''(x) = \delta(x-\bar x), \quad u'(0)=0, \quad u(1)=0
\]
and the functions $G_0(x)$ solving
\[
u''(x) = 0, \quad u'(0)=1, \quad u(1)=0
\]
and $G_1(x)$ solving
\[
u''(x) = 0, \quad u'(0)=0, \quad u(1)=1.
\]

\item 
Using this as guidance, find the general formulas for the elements of the
inverse of the matrix in equation (2.54).  Write out the $5\times 5$ matrices
$A$ and $A^{-1}$ for the case $h=0.25$.
