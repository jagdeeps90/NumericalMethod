The m-file {\tt ex7p11.m} implements several methods on the damped linear
pendulum system (7.11) of Example 7.11.  

\begin{enumerate}
\item Modify the m-file to also implement the 2-step explicit
Adams-Bashforth method AB2.

\item Test the midpoint, trapezoid, and AB2 methods (all of which are second
order accurate) for each of the following case (and perhaps others of your 
choice) and comment on the behavior of each method.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $a = 100, ~b=0$ (undamped),
\item $a = 100, ~b=3$ (damped),
\item $a = 100, ~b=10$ (more damped).
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
