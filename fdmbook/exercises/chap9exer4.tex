\exercise[(Jacobi iteration as time stepping)]{9.4}

Consider the Jacobi iteration (4.4) for the linear system $Au=f$ arising
from a centered difference approximation of the boundary value problem
$u_{xx}(x) = f(x)$. Show that this iteration can be interpreted as forward
Euler time stepping applied to the MOL equations arising from a centered
difference discretization of the heat equation $u_t(x,t) = u_{xx}(x,t) -
f(x)$ with time step $k = \half h^2$. 

Note that if the boundary conditions are held constant then the solution to
this heat equation decays to the steady state solution that solves the
boundary value problem.  Marching to steady state with an explicit method
is one way to solve the boundary value problem, though as we saw in Chapter
4 this is a very inefficient way to compute the steady state.
