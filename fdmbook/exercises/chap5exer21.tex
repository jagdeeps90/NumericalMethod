\exercise[(starting values)]{5.21}

In Example 5.18 it is claimed that generating a value $U^1$ using the first
order accurate forward Euler method and then computing using the midpoint
method gives a method that is globally second order accurate.  Check that
this is true by implementing this approach in \matlab\ for a simple ODE.
