\exercise[(modified equation for trapezoidal)]{10.7}

Determine the modified equation on which the method
\begin{equation*}
U_j^{n+1} = U_j^n - \frac{ak}{2h}(U_j^n-U_{j-1}^n + U_j^{n+1}-U_{j-1}^{n+1}).
\end{equation*}
from Exercise 10.4 is second order accurate.  Is this method predominantly
dispersive or dissipative?
