\exercise[(code for Poisson problem)]{3.1}

The \matlab\ script {\tt poisson.m} solves the Poisson problem on a square
$m\times m$ grid with $\Delta x = \Delta y = h$, using the 5-point
Laplacian.  It is set up to solve a test problem for which the exact
solution is $u(x,y) = \exp(x+y/2)$, using Dirichlet boundary conditions and
the right hand side $f(x,y) = 1.25 \exp(x+y/2)$.

\begin{enumerate} 
\item Test this script by performing a grid refinement study to verify that
it is second order accurate.

\item Modify the script so that it works on a rectangular domain $[a_x,b_x]
\times [a_y,b_y]$, but still with $\Delta x = \Delta y = h$.  Test your
modified script on a non-square domain.

\item Further modify the code to allow $\Delta x \neq \Delta y$ and test the
modified script.
\end{enumerate}
