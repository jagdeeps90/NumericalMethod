\exercise[(Use of {\tt ode113} and {\tt ode45})]{5.8}

This problem can be solved by a modifying the m-files odesample.m and
odesampletest.m available from the webpage.

Consider the third order initial value problem
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
&v'''(t) + v''(t) + 4v'(t) + 4v(t) = 4t^2 + 8t - 10,\\
&v(0) = -3,\quad v'(0) = -2,\quad v''(0) = 2.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Verify that the function
\[
v(t) = -\sin(2t) + t^2 - 3
\]
is a solution to this problem.  How do you know it is the unique solution?

\item Rewrite this problem as a first order system of the form $u'(t) =
f(u(t), t)$ where $u(t) \in \reals^3$.  Make sure you also specify the
initial condition $u(0) = \eta$ as a 3-vector.

\item Use the \matlab\ function {\tt ode113} to solve this problem over the
time interval $0\leq t \leq 2$.  Plot the true and computed solutions to
make sure you've done this correctly.  

\item Test the \matlab\ solver by specifying different tolerances spanning
several orders of magnitude.  Create a table showing the maximum error in
the computed solution for each tolerance and the number of function
evaluations required to achieve this accuracy.

\item Repeat part (d) using the \matlab\ function {\tt ode45}, which uses
an embedded pair of Runge-Kutta methods instead of Adams-Bashforth-Moulton
methods.

\end{enumerate}
