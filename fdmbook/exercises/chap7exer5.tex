Let $g(x)=0$ represent a system of $s$ nonlinear equations in $s$ unknowns,
so $x\in\reals^s$ and $g: \reals^s \goto \reals^s$.  A vector $\bar
x\in\reals^s$ is a {\em fixed point} of $g(x)$ if 
\eqlex{a}
\bar x = g(\bar x).
\end{equation}
One way to attempt to compute $\bar x$ is with {\em fixed point iteration}:
from some starting guess $x^0$, compute
\eqlex{b}
x^{j+1} = g(x^j)
\end{equation}
for $j=0,~1,~\ldots$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that if there exists a norm $\|\cdot\|$ such that $g(x)$ is
Lipschitz continuous with constant $L<1$ in a neighborhood of $\bar x$, then
fixed point iteration converges from any starting value in this
neighborhood.
{\bf Hint:} Subtract equation \eqnex{a} from \eqnex{b}.

\item Suppose $g(x)$ is differentiable and let $g'(x)$ be the $s\times s$
Jacobian matrix.  Show that if the condition of part (a) holds then
$\rho(g'(\bar x)) < 1$, where $\rho(A)$ denotes the spectral radius of a
matrix.

\item Consider a predictor-corrector method (see Section 5.9.4) consisting
of forward Euler as the predictor and backward Euler as the corrector, and
suppose we make $N$ correction iterations, i.e., we set
\begin{tabbing}
xxxxxxxxx\=xxxx\=\kill\\
\>$\hat U^0 = U^n + kf(U^n)$\\
\>for $j = 0,~1,~\ldots,~N-1$\\
\>\>$\hat U^{j+1} = U^n + kf(\hat U^j)$\\
\>\>end\\
\>$U^{n+1} = \hat U^N$.
\end{tabbing}
Note that this can be interpreted as a fixed point iteration for solving the
nonlinear equation
\[
\unp = U^n + kf(\unp)
\]
of the backward Euler method.  Since the backward Euler method is implicit
and has a stability region that includes the entire left half plane, as
shown in Figure 7.1(b), one might hope that this predictor-corrector method
also has a large stability region.

Plot the stability region $S_N$
of this method for $N=2,~5,~10,~20$ (perhaps using
{\tt plotS.m} from the webpage) and observe that in fact the stability
region does not grow much in size.

\item Using the result of part (b), show that the fixed point iteration
being used in the predictor-corrector method of part (c) can only be
expected to converge if $|k\lambda| < 1$ for all eigenvalues $\lambda$ of the
Jacobian matrix $f'(u)$.  

\item Based on the result of part (d) and the shape of the stability region
of Backward Euler, what do you expect the stability region $S_N$ of part (c)
to converge to as $N\goto\infty$?

\end{enumerate}
