\exercise[(Order of accuracy of Runge-Kutta methods)]{5.13}

Consider the Runge-Kutta methods defined by the tableaux below.  In each
case show that the method is third order accurate in two different ways:
First by checking that the order conditions (5.35), (5.37), and (5.38) are
satisfied, and then by applying one step of
the method to $u' = \lambda u$ and verifying that the Taylor series expansion
of $e^{k\lambda}$ is recovered to the expected order.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Runge's 3rd order method:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|cccc}
0\\
1/2&1/2\\
1&0&1\\
1&0&0&1\\
\hline\\
&1/6&2/3&0&1/6
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\item Heun's 3rd order method:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
0\\
1/3&1/3\\
2/3&0&2/3\\
\hline\\
&1/4&0
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{enumerate}
