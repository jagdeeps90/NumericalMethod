\exercise[(9-point Laplacian)]{3.2}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Show that the 9-point Laplacian (3.17) has the truncation error derived in
Section 3.5.
{\bf Hint:} To simplify the computation, note that the 9-point Laplacian can
be written as the 5-point Laplacian (with known truncation error) plus a
finite difference approximation that models $\frac 1 6 h^2 u_{xxyy} +
O(h^4)$.

\item
Modify the \matlab\ script {\tt poisson.m} to use the
9-point Laplacian (3.17) instead of the 5-point Laplacian, and to solve the
linear system (3.18) where $f_{ij}$ is given by (3.19).  Perform a grid
refinement study to verify that fourth order accuracy is achieved.

\end{enumerate}
