\exercise[(consistency and zero-stability of LMMs)]{6.3}

Which of the following Linear Multistep Methods are convergent?  For
the ones that are not, are they inconsistent, or not zero-stable, or both?
 \begin{enumerate} 
 \item $U^{n+2} = \half U^{n+1} + \half U^{n} + 2kf(U^{n+1})$
 \item $\unp = U^n$
 \item $U^{n+4} = U^{n} + \frac 4 3 k(f(U^{n+3})+f(U^{n+2})+f(U^{n+1}))$
 \item $U^{n+3} = -U^{n+2} + U^{n+1} +U^{n}+2k(f(U^{n+2})+f(U^{n+1}))$.
 \end{enumerate}
