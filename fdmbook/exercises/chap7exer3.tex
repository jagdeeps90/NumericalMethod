\exercise[(stability on a kinetics problem)]{7.3}

Consider the kinetics problem (7.8) with $K_1=3$ and $K_2=1$ and initial
data $u_1(0)=3,~u_2(0)=4,$ and $u_3(0)=2$ as shown in Figure 7.4.  Write a
program to solve this problem using the forward Euler method.  

\begin{enumerate} 
\item Choose a time
step based on the stability analysis indicated in Example 7.12 and determine
whether the numerical solution remains bounded in this case.  

\item How large can you choose $k$ before you observe instability in your
program?

\item Repeat parts (a) and (b) for $K_1=300$ and $K_2=1$.

\end{enumerate}
