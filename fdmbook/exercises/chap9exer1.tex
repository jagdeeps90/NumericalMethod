\exercise[(leapfrog for heat equation)]{9.1}

Consider the following method for solving the heat equation
$u_t=u_{xx}$:
\[
U_i^{n+2} = U_i^n + \frac{2k}{h^2}(U_{i-1}^{n+1} - 2U_i^{n+1} +
U_{i+1}^{n+1}).
\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine the order of accuracy of this method (in both space and time).

\item Suppose we take $k=\alpha h^2$ for some fixed $\alpha>0$ and refine
the grid.  For what values of $\alpha$ (if any) will this method be
Lax-Richtmyer stable and hence convergent?  

{\bf Hint:} Consider the MOL interpretation and the stability region of
the time-discretization being used.

\item Is this a useful method?
\end{enumerate}
