\exercise[(Convergence of backward Euler method)]{6.7}

Suppose the function $f(u)$ is Lipschitz continuous over some domain
$|u-\eta|\leq a$ with Lipschitz constant $L$.
Let $g(u) = u - kf(u)$ and let $\Phi(v) = g^{-1}(v)$, the inverse function. 

Show that for $k<1/L$, the function $\Phi(v)$ is Lipschitz continuous
over some domain $|v-f(\eta)| \leq b$ and determine a Lipschitz constant.  

{\bf Hint:} Suppose $v =  u - kf(u)$ and $v^* = u^* - kf(u^*)$ and 
obtain an upper bound on $|u-u^*|$ in terms of $|v-v^*|$.

{\bf Note:} The backward Euler method (5.21) takes the form
\[
U^{n+1} = \Phi(U^n)
\]
and so this shows that the implicit backward Euler method is convergent.
