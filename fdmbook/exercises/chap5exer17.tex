\exercise[($R(z)$ for the trapezoidal method)]{5.17}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Apply the trapezoidal method to the equation $u' = \lambda u$ and show
that
\[
U^{n+1} = \left( \frac{1 + z/2}{1 - z/2} \right) U^n,
\]
where $z = \lambda k$.

\item Let 
\[
R(z) = \frac{1 + z/2}{1 - z/2}.
\]
Show that $R(z) = e^z + \bigo(z^3)$ and conclude that the one-step error of
the trapezoidal method on this problem is $\bigo(k^3)$ (as expected since
the method is second order accurate).

Hint: One way to do this is to use the ``Neumann series'' expansion
\[
\frac{1}{1-z/2} = 1 + \frac z 2 + \left(\frac z 2\right)^2 + \left(\frac z
2\right)^3 + \cdots
\]
and then multiply this series by $(1 + z/2)$.
A more general approach to checking the accuracy of rational approximations
to $e^z$ is explored in the next exercises.
